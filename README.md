# GradeTool
Utility for grading CS projects submitted via moodle

The basic idea is that if you download the zipped submissions in moodle's standard format and extract them to a temporary location on your local disk, this utility can convert them into an Eclipse project, build them, run unit tests, etc. and leave you with everything nicely added to the Eclipse project so you can go through and grade.
